    "# Step-by-Step Summary of the EDA Process\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. **Data Collection**\n",
    "- **Datasets Used**:\n",
    "  - **Gym Members Exercise Dataset** from Kaggle (973 entries).\n",
    "  - **Personal Body Composition Data** from Garmin Index S2 scale (278 entries).\n",
    "- **Key Features**: Age, Gender, BMI, Fat Percentage, Workout Frequency, Calories Burned, Weight, Height, Session Duration, Experience Level.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. **Data Cleaning**\n",
    "- **Missing Values**:\n",
    "  - Verified no missing data in the Kaggle dataset.\n",
    "- **Outlier Removal**:\n",
    "  - Removed unrealistic records:\n",
    "    - Fat percentage < 3% or > 50%.\n",
    "    - Weight < 30 kg or > 200 kg.\n",
    "    - Height < 1.2 m or > 2.5 m.\n",
    "- **Incongruent Records**:\n",
    "  - Removed entries where:\n",
    "    - **Underweight** individuals had **High Fat** percentage.\n",
    "    - **Obesity** individuals had **Low Fat** percentage.\n",
    "    - Ensured data consistency by eliminating extreme or incorrect values.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. **Feature Engineering**\n",
    "- **BMI Status**:\n",
    "  - Classified BMI into:\n",
    "    - **Underweight**: BMI < 18.5\n",
    "    - **Normal weight**: BMI 18.5–24.9\n",
    "    - **Overweight**: BMI 25–29.9\n",
    "    - **Obesity**: BMI ≥ 30\n",
    "- **Fat Percentage Status**:\n",
    "  - Categorized fat percentage based on gender and age ranges as:\n",
    "    - **Low Fat**, **Healthy**, or **High Fat**.\n",
    "- **Muscle Mass Estimation**:\n",
    "  - Estimated muscle mass percentage using lean body mass, adjusted for gender, age, and experience level.\n",
    "- **Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)**:\n",
    "  - Calculated BMR using the Harris-Benedict equation based on weight, height, age, and gender.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**\n",
    "- **Descriptive Statistics**:\n",
    "  - Analyzed mean, median, and range for BMI, fat percentage, and workout frequency.\n",
    "- **Correlation Analysis**:\n",
    "  - Created a heatmap to visualize relationships between session duration, calories burned, BMI, and fat percentage.\n",
    "- **Data Visualizations**:\n",
    "  - **Histograms**: Showed distributions for Age, BMI, and Fat Percentage.\n",
    "  - **Bar Charts**: Displayed counts of BMI categories and fat status.\n",
    "  - **Scatter Plots**: Explored the relationship between session duration and calories burned.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. **Interpretation of Data**\n",
    "- **Interpretation Column**:\n",
    "  - Added insights based on BMI and fat percentage:\n",
    "    - **High Muscle Mass**: High BMI with low or healthy fat percentage.\n",
    "    - **Lean Body**: Normal weight with low fat percentage.\n",
    "    - **Need for Fat Reduction**: Normal weight with high fat percentage.\n",
    "    - **High Health Risk**: Obesity with high fat percentage.\n",
    "    - **Gain Muscle Mass**: Underweight with low or healthy fat percentage.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. **Workout Advisor Recommendations**\n",
    "- **Added Workout Advisor Column**:\n",
    "  - Provided tailored suggestions based on fat percentage, workout frequency, and calories burned:\n",
    "    - **Increase Workout Frequency**: Recommended for members with high fat percentage and less than 4 workout days per week.\n",
    "    - **Increase Workout Intensity**: Suggested for members burning fewer than 915 calories per session.\n",
    "    - **Maintain Current Plan**: Advised for individuals with balanced body composition and adequate training routine.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. **Key Findings**\n",
    "- High BMI is often linked to lower workout frequency.\n",
    "- High body fat percentage correlates with fewer workout days per week.\n",
    "- Positive relationship between session duration and calories burned, indicating longer sessions lead to higher calorie expenditure.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. **Limitations**\n",
    "- **Sample Size**: Small datasets may limit generalizability.\n",
    "- **Missing Metrics**: Important indicators like muscle mass, waist measurements, and blood pressure were not included.\n",
    "- **Bias**: Data may be skewed towards more advanced gym members who track their workouts consistently.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9. **Recommendations**\n",
    "- **Increase Workout Frequency**: Suggest members with high fat percentages work out 4-5 times per week.\n",
    "- **Boost Workout Intensity**: Recommend higher intensity for members burning fewer calories.\n",
    "- **Collect Additional Metrics**: Gather more comprehensive data such as muscle mass and waist circumference.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 10. **Conclusion**\n",
    "- The EDA provided valuable insights into how workout routines affect body composition.\n",
    "- Further analysis with additional health metrics is needed for more accurate recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 11. **Tools Used**\n",
    "- **Pandas** for data manipulation.\n",
    "- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for creating visualizations.\n",
    "- **Jupyter Notebook** for documenting the analysis process.\n",
    "\n",
